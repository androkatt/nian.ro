Role: Lead Creative Technologist (Award-Winning Portfolio Division).

Objective: Create a "Showstopper" Interactive DevOps Visualization (CyberPipeline.jsx) that replaces a static image.

CRITICAL FEEDBACK ON PREVIOUS ITERATION: The previous result was "dull" and "too simple." It looked like a PowerPoint slide. Requirement: The new version must look like a Holographic HUD or a Living Circuit Board. It needs "Energy," "Depth," and "Complexity."

The Visual Language (Cyber-Nervous System):

The Environment:

Add a subtle Perspective Grid (retro-wave style) on the floor that moves slowly to create 3D depth.

Background: Deep void (#030712) with faint floating binary or hex codes fading in/out.

The Nodes (The "Reactors"):

Shape: Hexagons (Tech aesthetic) instead of Circles.

Style: Glassmorphism (semi-transparent backgrounds with white borders).

Activity: Add "Orbital Rings" (dashed lines) spinning slowly around the active nodes.

The Connections (The "Data Highways"):

Use Dual-Line Cabling: One static dark cable (the rail) and one pulsing bright cable (energy).

Effect: Use SVG Gradients (Cyan to Purple) for the lines. Do not use solid colors.

The Energy (The "WOW" Factor"):

Particles: Instead of simple dots, use "Comets" (heads with fading tails) racing along the paths.

Neon Glow: You MUST define an SVG <filter id="neon-glow"> (Gaussian Blur) and apply it to the active cables and particles so they actually glow against the dark background.

The Architecture (Isometric Flow): Arrange the 5 nodes (GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, K8s, AWS) in a Zig-Zag or Isometric Step pattern (like a waterfall), not a flat line. This fills the vertical space better.

Interactivity:

Hover: When hovering a node (e.g., Docker):

The "Orbital Rings" spin faster (animation-duration: 1s).

The Node Hexagon fills with the brand color.

A "Holographic Card" projects upwards (Y-axis translation) showing the tech specs.

Tech Stack:

React + Tailwind CSS.

Pure SVG & CSS Modules: Use <defs> for gradients/filters. Use CSS @keyframes for the spinning rings and floating data.

Output: Provide the single file CyberPipeline.jsx. Include the SVG Filter definitions clearly at the top of the JSX.
